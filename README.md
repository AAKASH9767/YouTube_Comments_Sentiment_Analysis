 Here's a breakdown of your code:

You import the necessary libraries, including requests for making HTTP requests, json for working with JSON data, matplotlib.pyplot for creating plots, and nltk.sentiment.vader for sentiment analysis.

You set the API endpoint URL, video ID, and API key. Note that you've set the videoId parameter to "X0tOpBuYasI", which is different from the video_id variable you defined earlier. Ensure that you are using the correct video ID.

You define API request parameters in the params dictionary. These parameters include the part you want to retrieve (snippet), the video ID, and the API key.

You send the API request to retrieve comments in a loop until there are no more comments to fetch. You handle pagination by checking for the presence of a "nextPageToken" in the response JSON.

You initialize the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer from NLTK.

You categorize each comment as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment score obtained from VADER sentiment analysis. The sentiment score's "compound" value is used for this purpose.

You count the number of positive, negative, and neutral comments.

You print the counts of positive, negative, and neutral comments.

You define the data for the pie chart, including labels, sizes, and colors.

You create and display the pie chart using Matplotlib.

Finally, you print all the comments retrieved from the video.

A couple of things to note:

Make sure that the video ID you want to analyze matches the videoId parameter in the params dictionary.

The api_key variable is defined twice, once in the api_key variable and again in the params dictionary. You can use the one in the api_key variable to keep your code more organized.

Ensure you have installed the necessary libraries, such as requests, nltk, and matplotlib, and have the VADER sentiment analyzer correctly set up with NLTK. You may need to download the NLTK VADER lexicon and perform any additional setup steps as required by NLTK
